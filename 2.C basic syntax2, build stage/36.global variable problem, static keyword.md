### problems with global variables
- There's a common saying: "Don't use global variables"
- There's definitely a problem
    - If you use extern, anyone can access and even modify the variables in your file
    - With thousands of files, it can be difficult to track down which code is modifying a global variable
- How can you prevent others from using your global variables?
- To limit the use of a global variable to within your file only?
- Use the `static` keyword when defining the global variable



### Example of using the `static` keyword
```c
/* repo.h */
void add_something(void);
```


```c
/* repo.c */
#include "repo.h"

static int g_count = 0; /* static keyword */
void add_something(void)
{
    ++g_count;
}
```


```c
/* main.c */
#include <stdio.h>
#include "repo.h"

extern in g_count; 

int main(void)
{
    add_something();
    printf("added something: %d\n", g_count); /* error */

    return 0;
}
```
- The code will compile, but it will fail to link, resulting in a linker error (as if the variable doesn't exist at all)
- `static` means the variable is fixed for use within the file only



### `static` keyword
- Prevent access to global variables from other files
- Limits the scope of the variable to the file where it’s declared
- Commonly referred to as a **static variable**
- Even though it's still a global variable, it occupies memory throughout the program’s execution
- If you try to access a static variable from another file, a linker error occurs



### Another meaning of static:
- Without **static**, a variable is local. Once the function returns, the variable disappears
- Using `static` makes the global variable but it’s only accessible within that function
    - This means that even after the function returns, the value remains stored
- A `static` variable is only initialized **once**



### What about a static function?
- If you put the `static` keyword in front of a function, it prevents access from outside the file
