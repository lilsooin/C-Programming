### how include guard works
- Preprocessor directives are processed by the preprocessor before the code is compiled
- During this process, 1) define certain constants, and 2) instruct the compiler to **conditionally compile code**

```c
/* foo.h */
#ifndef FOO_H
#define FOO_H
/* header file contents */
#endif /* FOO.H */
```
- `#ifndef`: If FOO_H is not defined
- `#define`: Define FOO_H
- `/* header file contents */`: And include this code as usual.
- `#endif /* FOO.H */`: end of the `#ifndef` block
