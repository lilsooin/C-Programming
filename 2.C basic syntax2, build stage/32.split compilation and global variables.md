### multiple files and C build
- For very large projects, it's usually better to group similar functions together and store them in separate files by functionality
- It would be very difficult if everyone tried to modify a single file
    Changes might conflict with each other, and there would be compilation time issues
- Multiple files are compiled



### Split compilation
1. Two or more .c files are individually compiled into object files
2. The object files are then linked together to create an executable file
