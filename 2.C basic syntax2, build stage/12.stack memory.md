### How to make array with out 'new'?
- In C#, the new keyword is used
    - The variable from new keyword is reference type
    - So can not copy the array
    - Array and Object



### In C, Array can make a value type as well
- In fact, all variables can make both value type and reference type
- Let's how value type works inside



### Stack memory
- It is different from data structure 'stack'
    - just same method LIFO
- `The temporary storage space used for local variables and other data in each function is called the 'stack memory'`
- The size of the stack memory is determined at build time
- The location of the stack memory is determined at runtime
- First time, Data is saved at code, data section
- Local variables are saved at stack(when function is called we need to know local variable information)
- LIFO
