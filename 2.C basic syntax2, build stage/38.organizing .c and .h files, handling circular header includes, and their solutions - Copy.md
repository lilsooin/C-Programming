### organizing .c and .h file 
- To ensure the four stages of the build process work correctly, the following basic principles must be followed:
1. Only declarations should be placed in header files
    - Function declaration
    - Global variable declaration
2. Definitions should be placed in .c file
    - Function definition
    - Global variable and static variable definition



### imagine this situations
```c
/* a.h */
# include "b.h"

/* code */
```

```c
/* b.h */
# include "a.h"

/* code */
```

```c
/* c.h */
# include "a.h"

/* code */
```
- when c.c is compiled?
- a copy b
- b copy a
- a copy b
- ...
- It is called **circular header includes**



### solution1: try to avoid these situations
- Use `#include` only in .c
- Forward declaration defined a in **b header** instead of using include a header in **b header**
- However, sometimes header files must include each other
    - For example, when `b.h` needs a `#define` that is defined in `a.h`



### solution2: include guard
- The standard way to prevent a header file from being included multiple times in C
```c
/* foo.h */
#ifndef FOO_H
#define FOO_H
/* header file contents */
#endif /* FOO.H */
```
- If it starts `#`
    - It is **preprocessor directive**
    - #define, #ifdef, #ifndef, #endif
