###
매개변수 배열의 길이를 알 방법이 없다
- There is no way to know the length of the parameter array.
- None.
    - Exception: When you can use ARRAY_LENGTH (macro).
    - The size of the array must be remembered separately.
- The function mentioned earlier should be written like this.
```c
void process(size_t n, int nums[]) {
    size_t i;
    for (i = 0; i < n; ++ i) {
        nums[i] *= 2;
    }
}
```

### Initial value of array elements
- C does not initialize the values of array elements (C# initializes them to 0)
- Therefore, it uses whatever values were previously in that memory
    - This applies to variables as well
```c
int nums[30]; /* You don’t know what values are inside (garbage values) */
int val; /* same */
```
- You know how to initialize a variable, but how do you initialize array elements?
