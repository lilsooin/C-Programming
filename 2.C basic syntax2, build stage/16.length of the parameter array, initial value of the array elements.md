### There is no way to know the length of the parameter arrays
- None.
    - Exception: When you can use ARRAY_LENGTH (macro).
    - The size of the array must be remembered separately.
- The function mentioned earlier should be written like this.
```c
void process(size_t n, int nums[]) {
    size_t i;
    for (i = 0; i < n; ++ i) {
        nums[i] *= 2;
    }
}
```

### Initial value of array elements
- C does not initialize the values of array elements (C# initializes them to 0)
- Therefore, it uses whatever values were previously in that memory
    - This applies to variables as well
```c
int nums[30]; /* You donâ€™t know what values are inside (garbage values) */
int val; /* same */
```
- You know how to initialize a variable, but how do you initialize array elements?



### Initialization of array elements
```C
int nums1[4];                     /* Filled with garbage values */
int nums2[4] = {10, 15, 3, -1};   /* All initialized */
int nums3[4] = {10, 15};          /* 10, 15, 0, 0 */
int nums4[2] = {10 , 15, 3};      /* compile error */
int nums5[] = {10, 15, 3};        /* Array size = 3, the compiler determines the array size */
```



### best practice: Initialize all values of the array to 0
- How to initialize all values of the array to 0
```c
int nums[10] = { 0, };
```
- type , behind number 0
- it refers all values initialize to 0



### that's why C is dangerous
- you might use local value which it isn't initialized
- enable buffer overflow 
    - nobody checks buffer overflow
- `example of buffer overflow`
```c
int buffer[2] = {2 , 2};
int buffer2[2] = {1, 1};
size_t i;

for(i = 0; i <= 2; ++i) {
    buffer2[i] = 0;
}
```
- **When using buffer2[2], it can exceed its bounds and change the value in buffer[2]**
- this problem is called 'buffer overflow'
- memory stomp
