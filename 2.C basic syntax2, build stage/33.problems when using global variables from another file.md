### An error might occurs during split compilation
- If the compiler compiles each .c file separately, it can't find the variable and produces an error.
- You need to tell the compiler that you're going to use a variable from another .c file
- Then the compiler leaves a "hole" for that variable
- It's like a function declaration (forward declaration)
