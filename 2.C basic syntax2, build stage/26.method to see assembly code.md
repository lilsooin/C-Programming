### method to see assembly code
- Use compile flag -S, assembly code save into .s file
`clang -std=c89 -W -Wall -pedantic-errors -S adder.c`


### What does it mean when assembly code has been produced?
- After this stage, the code will only run on a specific platform
- C is cross-platform only holds true until it is compiled
- Additionally, the size of data types in C can vary depending on the bit architecture of the target platform
    - Assembly code is produced after the size of data types has already been determined
- Once C is compiled into assembly, it becomes code that runs only on a specific platform (assembly code differs across machines and platforms)
