### C programming build process
- What is build?
    - The process of coverting Human-Readable source code into Machine Language Instructions
    - Then, gathering these instructions to create an executable file that can be run on a machine
- The build process of C program is divided into four stages
    1. Preprocessing
    2. compilation
    3. assembling
    4. linking

- green box: compliation
- blue box: compliation as well 


### I didn't do four stages of build process
- usually build like this below
    **> clang -std=c89 -W -Wall edantic-errors *.c**
- So clang automatically executes four stages
    - The result is final execute file(`.exe`, `.out`)

### header file and c file
```c
/* adder.h */
int add(const int a, const int b);
```

```c
/* adder.c */
#include "adder.h"

int add(const int a, const int b) 
{
    return a + b;
}
```

```c
/* main.c */
#include "adder.h"

int main(void)
{
    const int rest = add(1, 2);
    return 0;
}
```
