### It is able to build to library
- It is able to make build to library file not execute file
- library
    - Functions and other code are converted to machine code and stored in a single file
    - Later, if another `.c` file needs this functionality, it can be linked together for use
- There are two types of libraries
    - static library
    - dynamic library
- Library is a binary file that contains code



### static library and link
- Linking with a static library is called static linking
- The machine code in the library is copied into the final executable file
- Compared to dynamic linking,
    - the executable file size is larger
    - can consume more memory
    - execution speed is faster




### dynamic library and link
- Linking with a dynamic library is called dynamic linking
- This method leaves a hole in the executable file
- The actual linking occurs when the executable file is run
    - This linking is done by the operating system during execution
- The linking occurs during runtime
- Compared to static linking,
    - executable file size is smaller
    - multiple executables can share the same library
        -> saving memory
- If multiple executables use the same-named but different version dynamic libraries, you might encounter "DLL Hell."


### `.dll` file
- dll stands for Dynamic Link Library
- Sometimes, you might get an error saying a dll is missing when playing a game


- With static libraries, the necessary files include the static library, resulting in larger file sizes
