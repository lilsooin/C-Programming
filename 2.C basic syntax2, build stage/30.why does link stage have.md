### Why does link stage have
- People usually thinks compliation and link stage
- It can't not fill holes every compliation
- So linker take object codes and fill holes
- .o file -> .exe file
- In visual studio, generally makes object file, .exe file both
- In clang just make .exe file
    how to make .exe file from .o file 
    `clang -std=c89 -W -Wall -pedantic-errors main.o adder.o`
    `clang -std=c89 -W -Wall -pedantic-errors *.o`
