### Compilation stage: output

A compiler generates assembly code during compilation
```shell
# to get assembly file
clang -S -o multiply.s multiply.c
```
- Assembly language corresponds almost 1:1 with machine code (very close to the hardware)
- However, since it is a text file, it remains a language that is still easy for humans to read
- Assembly code can use symbols that have not yet been defined
    - Symbols: names of functions or variables, etc
    - This is why compilation is possible with just declarations through headers
- When the compiler cannot find the definition of a function or variable
    - It acts as follows, just by looking at the declaration
        - "Hmm, there's no definition for this function or variable? It must be somewhere."
        - "Someone will fill in the address of this function or variable later. I'll leave it as a hole."
- The holes are filled during the linking stage
