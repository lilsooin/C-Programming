### Link stage
!['link stage'](/link%20stage.png)
- **Linker** manages this stage
- input: all object codes
- Linker collects all object codes, fills in the holes, and then saves it as an executable file



### How to fill the holes
- 요약: Linker remembers function location and when it meets code which call the function, it inserts address in the code
- Linker gathers all the object files and creates a single binary file, remembering the locations of the functions
- When it encounters code that attempts to call a function, it inserts a jump to that stored location(address) at the execution point
- What if a function or variable, used based on a declaration, still remains hole? (i.e., the linker couldn't find its definition in any other object code)
    - The linker throws a linker error, indicating that it couldn't find the definition
    - Since there's no way to execute without that function or variable, it results in an error, not just a warning
- Output: The final executable file (.exe, .out)
