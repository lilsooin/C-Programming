### goto
```C
goto <lable_name>;
...
<lable_name>:
```
- C executes code sequentially from top to bottom.
- Using goto breaks this order and allows you to specify the next line of code to execute arbitrarily
- You can jump to a label within the same function.
- At the programmer's discretion,
    - For example, if you want to execute the 30th line of code after the 10th line,
    - goto makes this possible.


### goto example(bad)
```C
// C
void do_work(void)
{
infinity:
    printf("work time!\n");

    goto infinity;
}
```
- = same code
```C
// C
void do_work(void)
{
    while (1) {
        printf("work time!\n");
    }
}
```



### another loop(do-while) example
```C
/* C */
int main(void)
{
    int counter = 3;

    do {
        printf("play time\n");
    } while (counter-- > 0);

    /* same code */
    counter = 3;

loop:
    printf("play time\n");

    if (counter-- > 0) {
        goto loop;
    }
}
```

### loop is also goto code
- There is no loop in assembly
- loop is safter than goto
