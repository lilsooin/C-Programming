# C-Programming


### The reason why we should learn C
- C is an old language, but it is still useful and widely used

- C/C++ is 2nd rank 19.64% (Python 20.17%)
- It is still used in many industries
    - Operation system(OS)
        - Linux, Windows, IOS, Android
    - Embedded Systems 
    - Video game
    - Graphic applications
    - Web browers
    - Medical devices

### The reason why we should learn C 2
1. Learning the C language helps you better understand computer science concepts such as:
    a. Memory mechanisms
    b. CPU mechanisms
    c. How computers work

2. C is one of the closest languages to hardware:
    a. It is often used for embedded systems
    b. C allows the use of pointers

3.  C language provides a great opportunity to understand the concept of **'indirection'**. 
    - How a computer uses data stored in memory

4. Indirect referencing is used in the following situations
    - OOP (polymorphic function calls)
    - Recursive data type: when an object contains another object of the same type
    - To understand the concept of shallow copy and deep copy, it is necessary to understand indirect referencing
    - Java and C# use pointers in objects


### C is the mother of all languages
- Most of the languages currently in use are influenced by C
