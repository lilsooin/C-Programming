### the position of each element in an array
- The byte interval between each element in an array is consistent
```c
int nums[5];
char chars[5];
```

### Calculate the position of each element
- Therefore, if you know the address of the first element and the size of the data type, you can find the address of the second element
    - The address of the second element = address of the first element + size of the data type (in bytes)
    - The address of the third element = address of the second element + size of the data type (in bytes)
    - Repeat



### Adding an integer to a pointer:
- Adding 1 to a pointer moves the pointer to the next data location
    - ex)
    ```c
    int* ptr = nums; /* ptr: 0x100 */    
    ptr = ptr + 3;
    ```
    - If you add 3 to an int pointer, you move 3 times the size of an int
    - 0x100 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 0x10c
- If it's a short* instead of int*, it increases by 2 bytes each time
- The same applies for subtraction
- The same applies for ++ and --



### These two codes have the same meaning:
```c
int* ptr1 = nums + 3; // ptr1 points to nums[3]
int* ptr2 = &nums[3]; // ptr2 points to nums[3].
```
- The array index value can be understood as an offset value
- &nums[3]: 3 offest
