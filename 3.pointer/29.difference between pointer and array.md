### Difference between Pointers and Array
- In most cases, pointers and arrays can be treated the same
- But it can be different


### 1. sizeof operator
- sizeof(array) and sizeof(pointer) return different values
    - sizeof(array): return array size
    - sizeof(pointer): return pointer size

```c
int nums[3] = { 34, 135, 49 };

int* ptr = nums;

size_t size1 = sizeof(nums); /* 12 * 3 x  4 */
size_t size2 = sizeof(ptr); /* 4 */
```


### string initialization
- C does not have a string data type like C# or Java
- Strings are represented using a char array
- For example, if you store the word 'Friday', you create a char array with a total of 6 (+1) elements
    - To indicate the end of a string, a special character called the **null character** is always placed at the very end
    - Null character: its value is 0, represented as `\0`
- **There are two ways to initialize a string**
1. method1
`char day[] = "Monday";`
    - The string 'M', 'o', 'n', 'd', 'a', 'y' is stored in the array sequentially, with `\0` added at the end
    - If used inside a function, it is stored in stack memory
2. method2
`char* day2 = "Monday";`
- Pointer variables are stored in the stack
- The actual string is stored in the data section
- Strings stored in the stack can be modified, but modifying strings stored in the data section results in "undefined behavior."
    - In the latter case, the string is read-only
```c
char day1[] = "Monday";
char* day2 = "Monday";

day1[0] = 'P' /* OK */
day2[0] = 'p' /* undefined behavior */
```


### assign
- You can assign a value to a pointer variable, but not to an array variable
```c
int* pointer1;
int* pointer2;
int array1[5];
int array2[5];
int x = 5;

pointer1 = array1;
array1 = pointer1; /* compile error */

pointer1 = &x;
array1 = &x; /* compile error */

pointer1 = pointer2;
array1 = array2; /* compile error */
```


### pointer arithmetic operation
- Pointers can perform arithmetic operations, but arrays cannot
- If you want to increment or decrement the address of an array, you can assign the array's address to a pointer and then increment/decrement the pointer
```c
++pointer;
--pointer;

pointer += 1;
pointer -= 2;

++array; /* compile error */
--array; /* compile error */

array += 1; /* compile error */
array -= 1; /* compile error */
```
