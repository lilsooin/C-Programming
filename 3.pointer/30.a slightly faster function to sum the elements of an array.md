### A slightly faster function to sum the elements of an array
```c
int sum(int* start, int* end)
{
    int result = 0;
    int* p = start;

    while (p < end) {
        result += *p++;
    }

    return result;
}

/* main function */
int nums[] = { 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 };
int result = sum(nums, nums + 5);
```
- Accessing elements like *p++ is slightly faster than using an array
- An array is always accessed by the first address + the offset of the elementâ€™s position
- A pointer already points to the next address, so it can be referenced directly
