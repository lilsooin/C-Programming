### purpose of pointers 1: large data as a parameter
- When large data is passed as a parameter
    - What if there are 100,000 elements?
    - As the data grows, time is wasted copying the data
    - Therefore, when an array is passed as a parameter, the address of the first element is passed



### purpose of pointers 2: more than one return value
- In C, itâ€™s impossible to return multiple values using the **return** statement
- You must always return only one value
- However, by using pointers, you can modify the original directly within a function
- If you overwrite without reading the original value, it's essentially the same as returning a value



### purpose of pointers 3: Dynamic memory allocation
- 
If you have data that you want to use for a while regardless of the scope of the function, use it in the following cases:
    - When the size of the data cannot be determined during compilation
    - when you want to use the data for a time shorter than the program's execution lifespan
- Dynamically allocated memory is also a contiguous block of memory
- Therefore, pointers are suitable (for similar reasons to arrays)




### purpose of pointers 4: Other
- When implementing data structures
    - Pointers are suitable for data structures like linked lists, trees, etc
- When you need to directly access memory in hardware, such as in embedded programming
    - Some hardware requires you to directly copy image data to a specific memory location to display images
