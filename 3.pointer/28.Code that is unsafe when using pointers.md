### unsafe code
```c
int i;
int num = 1024;

int* nums[3] = { 34, 135, 49 };

int* ptr = nums;

for (i = -1; i <=3; ++i) {
    printf("%p: %d\n", (void*)(ptr + 1), *(ptr + i));
}
```
- Itâ€™s hard to just avoid using them because theyâ€™re unsafe...
- But they're too powerful not to use
- Accessing an address is much faster than copying values
