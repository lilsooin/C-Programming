### const variable
1. It must be initialized at the time of creation
2. After initialization, the value cannot be changed
3. It can be assigned to a non-const variable
4. (Pointer-specific) The value of the object pointed to by a `const` pointer can be changed
```c
// const int variable
const int score = 100;
score = 0; /* compile error */

int lee_score = score;
```

```c
//  int* const variable
int* const p = &num;
p = &score; /* compile error */

int* q = p;

*p = 1234;
```


### A pointer to `const`: protects the value
```c
const int* p = &num1; /* method 1 */
int const *p = &num1; /* method 2 */
```
- If there is a mistake, it can cause problems not only within the function but also globally
- This is more important than protecting the address
- This `const` must be carefully considered
- It prevents changes to the value stored at that address
- Method 1: p is a pointer to int, which is `const`
-  Method 2: p is a pointer to `const` int
- Logically, Method 2 makes more sense, but Method 1 is more commonly used
- Since we also say `const int` when making an int constant (not a pointer), Method 1 is used more often to make it look similar
```c
int display_user(const int* id, const char* name)
{
    int result;

    // cant not change the value from the address

    return result;
}
```
