### data type stored at memory address? 
- Hardware doesn't care
    - if the bit pattern is read as a char, it is a char
    - read as a int, it is a int
    - read as a float, it is a float
- ex): apporach address 0x100

- But we have to infrom the hardware how many bytes to read from address
- Therefore, when declaring a pointer variable, you prefix the pointer with a data type to specify 'what type of data' is at that address
    - For example, **int** pointer, **float** pointer, **char** pointer and so on..
