### pointer and const
- The const in `pointers` is confusing because there are two things to protect



### A const pointer that protects the address
- For basic data type variables, if you add `const`, you cannot change the value stored in that variable
    - Generally, it doesn't feel absolutely necessary
    - Therefore, many coding standards don't enforce adding `const`
    - Even if mistakes occur, they usually donâ€™t cause significant issues
    - It mostly prevents mistakes within the scope of a function
```c
void do_something(const int op1)
{
    op1 = 20; /* compile error */
}
```
- You read pointer variables from right to left
`int* const p = &num;`
- `p` is a constant pointer to an integer
