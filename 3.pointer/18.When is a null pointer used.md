### When is a null pointer used?(1)
1. When you want to initialize a pointer variable
    - When there is no address to reference yet
```c
void do_something(void)
{
    int* ptr = NULL; /* When you don't need to use it right away, so initialize it with a null pointer */
    ptr = &g_monster_count; /* To store the address of a global variable */
}
```
- If performance is critical, you might choose not to initialize the pointer



### When is a null pointer used?(2)
Pointer risk1
2. When you want to check if a pointer variable is referencing a valid address
    - What happens if you dereference a pointer that points to nothing
        -> **Undefined behavior**
    - Always check if a pointer is a null pointer before dereferencing it
```c
void do_something(void)
{
    int* ptr = &num;
   
    ptr = NULL
    *ptr = 100; /*Undefined behavior */
}
```



### When is a null pointer used?(3)
Pointer risk2
3. To prevent dangling pointers
    - If a dynamically allocated memory block is no longer needed and has been freed, but there is still a pointer pointing to it?
    - Since the data can no longer be used, you need to initialize the address stored in the pointer variable
    - At this point, use a null pointer to reset it
