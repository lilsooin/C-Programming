## If there's dereferencing, does that mean there's also referencing?


### pointer
- What a pointer is already doing
- Instead of directly using the value of a variable, you 'reference' where it is located
- In other words, it points to where the value is


### dereference
- Not Going directly to the address
- Indirectly accessing the data
- Accessing indirectly using the address
- Therefore, it's also called the indirection operator


```c
void print_address(int* num)
{
    printf("address of num: %p\n", (void*)num);
}

/* main function */
int score = 88;
print_address(&score);
```
- But what can you really do in this function
- Just showing the address doesn't mean much


### Print the value stored at the address
```c
void print_address(void)
{
    int score = 200;
    int* pointer = &score;

    printf("score: %d\n", *pointer);
}

void print_arugment(float* arg)
{
    printf("arugment: %d\n", *arg);
}


/* main function */
float pi;

print_value();

pi = 3.14f
print_argument(&pi);
```

### dereference operator
- It is not multiplication operator
    - multiplication operator two errand
