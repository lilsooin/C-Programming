### The value stored in a pointer is an address
- In C, there are only two ways to obtain this address
1. The address-of operator `&`
```c
float pi = 3.14f;
float* p = &pi;
```
2. The name of the array
    - The name of the array indicates the starting address of the array
```c
int days[] = { 1, 2, 3, ... , 30, 31 };
int* p = days;
```


### Adding an integer to a pointer moves the address
- Adding or subtracting an integer **n** to/from a pointer always moves the memory address by "sizeof(data type) x n"
```c
char* char_ptr = char_array; /* 0x100 */
char_ptr = char_ptr + 10; /* 0x10A */

int* int_ptr = int_array; /* 0x100 */
int_ptr = int_ptr + 10; /* 0x128 */
```

### What if you really want to move by just **one** byte?
Cast the pointer to a one-byte pointer type
```c
int_ptr = (char*)int_ptr + 1;
```
