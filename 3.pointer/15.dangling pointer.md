### dangling pointer
- However, the 'address' used by the local variable itself does not disappear
- Therefore, returning that address does not cause a compile error
    - Depending on the compiler, it may give a warning
- The problem is that the pointer points to an **invalid address**
- In this case, unexpected results may occur
- Such a pointer is called a dangling pointer
- **This is code that should never be written**


### pointer and function return value(2)
```c
int* spawn_monster(void)
{
    static int s_monster_count = 0;

    /* code */
    ++s_monster_count;

    return &s_monster_count;
}

/* antoher function */
int* count_pointer;
count_pointer = spawn_monster();
```
- Be cautious of dangling pointers when returning a pointer
- When is Okay to return a pointer?
    - global variable
    - static global variable in file
    - static variable in function
    - the data is created in heap memory


### pointer and function return value(3)
- When should you return a pointer?
    - When you want to use a variable created inside a helper function in another function
        - However, it should not be a regular local variable (it disappears from the stack once the function call ends)
- When you create large data within a function and want to return it
    - In this case, the data is created in heap memory, not stack memory
