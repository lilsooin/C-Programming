### Yes
- Because pointer is also variable
- So pointer can change memory address value

```c
void change_pointer(void)
{
    char ch1 = 'C';
    char ch2 = 'z';

    char* pointer = &ch1;
    printf("%p: %c\n", (void*)pointer, *pointer);

    pointer = &ch2;
    printf("%p: %c\n", (void*)pointer, *pointer);
}
```
