### Explanation of two const
```c
int* const p = &num;
// Restrict changing the memory address
```

```c
const int* p = &num;
// Restrict changing the value stored at that memory address
```

```c
// const pointer protecting address
char ch = 'A';

char* const p = &ch;
*p = 'Z';
```

```c
// const pointer protecting address pointing value
char ch1 = 'A';
char ch2 = 'A';

const char*p = &ch1;
p = &ch2;
```
