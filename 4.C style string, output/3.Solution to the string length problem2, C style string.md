### method2: Marks the position where the string ends
- Use only char[] and place a **special character** at the position where the string ends
    - It is similar to returning an invalid index, -1, if the value cannot be found in the array
```c
size_t index_of(const char*, char c)
{
    /* If the character c is in the string str, return the corresponding index */

    /* if it doesn't exit, return -1 
    */
    return -1
}
```



### method2: Marks the position where the string ends2
- There are special characters in ASCII code that are not displayed on the screen
    - These are called control characters
    - 0-31, 127
- One of them is the number 0
- It is called a **null character**
- It is different from a null pointer



### method2: Marks the position where the string ends3
- 0 is a number
- \ is an escape character
- But since it's ASCII code 0, you can write it as `char null_char = 0;`
- However, it is recommended to use `'\0'` for readability
- **A C-style string refers to a char array that ends with a null character = null-terminated string**




### C-style string 1
- Consists only of char[]
- A null character is appended where the string ends
- ex) 'H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', '\0'



### C-style string 2
- These two codes are identical except for the storage location
    - The compiler automatically adds '\0' at the end of the string, even if not explicitly added
```c
char str[] = 'abc'; /* save "abc" in stack */
char* str2 = "abc"; /* save "abc" in data section */
```


 
### C-style string 3
- owever, in this case, '\0' is not added
`char str[] = { 'a', 'b', 'c' };`
