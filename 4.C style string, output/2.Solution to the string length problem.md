### Method 1: Store the length at the first position of the array
- Store the string length at the first memory location
- Let the actual string follow afterward
- Storing the length as `unsigned char` is too short (maximum 255) **2^8**
- Store the string length at the first memory location
!['memory exmaple1'](./memory%20example.png)




- Let the actual string follow afterward
- Store the length as **int**, followed by the characters in **char**
!['memory exmaple2'](./memory%20example2.png)


### Advantage of method 1
- By looking at the first address, you know the total number of characters




### Method 1 is a technique used in other languages
- The reason other languages can directly know the size of a string
- Is because they store the string length this way
```c#
// C#
string message = "Hello";
Console.WriteLine($"message len: " {message.Length});
```



### Disadvantage of method 1
- A single character is 1 byte, but you need 4 bytes for the length
    - This is typically used in classes or structs
- tâ€™s unclear how to write this purely in C code
    - You need to cast the first data as `int*` to read, then read the rest as `char*`
```C
char array[9]; /* size5 and string "hello" are written */

int* len = (int*)&array[0];
char* str = &array[4]; /* read str[0] - str[4] */
```
