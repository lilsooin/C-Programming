### The reason formatted strings are needed
- No overloading -> impossible using printf(int), printf(char)
- And temporary strings are not automatically generated
```c#
// C#
Console.WriteLine("Hello, " + name + "\nYour score is " + score);
```

```c
// c
printf("Hello, " + name + "\nYour score is " + score); /* compile error */
```
- Of course, the programmer can manage temporary strings directly using `strcat()`
    - You can do that if you want
- In other words, formatted strings output existing data types as characters to the output stream without additional memory allocation!
- Similar to C#'s string format
    - It all starts here



### `fprintf()` is the same
- But here, a stream is used
```c
const char* name = "Java";
fprintf(stdout, "Hello, %s\n", name);
```
- Usually, 3 streams are provided by default when a program runs
    - `stdout` (console output)
    - `stdin` (console input)
    - `stderr` (console output, but used for error messages)
    - These 3 streams are called standard streams



### **stdout**
- The console stream we've been seeing all along
- **stdout** usually uses line buffering
- buffering
    - It doesn't output immediately even if there is content to output; it accumulates it
