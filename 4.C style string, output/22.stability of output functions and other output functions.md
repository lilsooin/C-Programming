### But is the output function safe?
```c
char buffer[20];
const char* name = "Suin Lee";
int score = 100;

sprintf(buffer, "%s's score: %d\n", name, score);
```
- It is not safe...
- Same reasons with strcpy(), strcat()



### Then, there is a safe function with 'n' in it?
- It doesn't exist in C89
- It was introduced in C99 as snprintf()
- However, there are non-standard functions provided differently by each compiler
    - For example, in Microsoft Visual C, it's _snprintf()
    - However, since it's not a standard, it behaves differently
    - For details, refer to snprintf()



### Other output functions
```c
int puts(const char* str);
int fputs(const char* str, FILE* stream);
```

- puts()
    - Outputs a string to stdout
    - It also adds a newline at the end: '\n'
    - Very similar to fputs(str, stdout)
```c
int putchar(int ch);
int fputc(int ch, FILE* stream);
```
- putchar()
    - Outputs a character to stdout
    - Equivalent to fputc(ch, stdout)
