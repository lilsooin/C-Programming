### Output
- The act of showing data from the program to the outside
- Since the program knows what data to output, there are no weird data
- Therefore, it is easier than input



### Formatted output
- The most basic function when discussing output in C
- Three types
    - printf(): console(stdout) output
    - fprintf(): stream output
    - sprintf(): string output
- fprintf() and sprintf() work the same as printf()
    - The only difference is that you give 'the destination of output' as the first argument

```c
const char* msg = "Hello POCU";

fprintf(stdout, "%s\n", msg);
printf("%s\n"m msg);
```


### Format string
```c
printf("Hello Pocu"); // string
printf("%d", score);  // integer
printf("%c" ch);      // char
printf("%f", pi);     // float
printf("%s", name);   // string
printf("Hello, %s\nYour score is %d\n", name, score);  // mix
```
- It takes either a regular string or a format string as an argument
- Format string
    - A string that starts with %
    - A string that tells how many decimal places, how to align the width, and what kind of data (numbers, characters) to print
- A format string can contain one or more data
- At this time, the data is passed as additional arguments to printf() in the same order as the format specifiers
