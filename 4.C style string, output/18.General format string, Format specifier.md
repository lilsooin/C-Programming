### General Format string form
`%[flag][width][.number percise | .string min/max][length]foramt specifier`
- In general, a % can be followed by up to 4 specifiers
1. Flag (optional)
2. Width (optional)
3. Precision (optional)
    - Numeric precision
    - Minimum/maximum number of characters to output for a string
4. Length (optional)
5. Format specifier (required)
- The order must be followed exactly



### Format specifier(1)
%: display '%' `printf("%%\n");`
c: display char `printf("%\n", D);`
s: display char[] `printf("%s\n, "Bye");`
- It's called a format character
- Since % is used in format strings, you must escape it by repeating it to print
    - Similar to how in the past, you had to use '\' to print '\\' because of escape characters
- Instead of using "%s", you could directly print the string with printf()
    - However, itâ€™s useful when combining two strings or a string and a number for output
```c
printf(name); /* const char* name = "Bye"; */
printf("%s", name);
printf("Hello, %s\n Your are", name, string);
```



### Format specifier(2)
- d: Printing a signed integer `printf("%d\n", -10);`
- u: Printing an unsigned integer `printf("%u\n", 10);`
- o: Printing an unsigned integer in octal format 
'0' is not prefixed to the number.`printf("%o\n", 10);`
- x: Printing an unsigned integer in lowercase hexadecimal format
'0x' is not prefixed to the number. `printf("%x\n", 10);`
- X: Printing an unsigned integer in uppercase hexadecimal format
'0x' is not prefixed to the number `printf("%X\n, 10);`
- If you input a signed number into "%u", it prints the corresponding unsigned number based on the bit patter
```c
printf("%u\n", -10); /* print 4294967286 */
```
- The reason there is "%X" but no "%O"
    - It's because octal numbers are composed only of digits



### Format specifier(3)
- f: Printing a floating-point number `printf("%f\n", 3.14);`
- e/E: Printing a floating-point number in exponential notation `printf("%e\n", 3.14);`
- p: Printing a pointer value `printf("%p\n", (void*)name);`
- "%p" prints an address but only accepts void*
    - Since all addresses are of the same length, it's safe to cast any pointer to void*




### Precision
- Used with the format specifier 'f'
    - Minimum width. The number of decimal places
    - (Including the decimal point) If the minimum width is larger than the original number, it's padded with spaces
    - (Not including the decimal point) If the specified number of decimal places is greater than the original number's decimal places, it's padded with zero
    - The default number of decimal places is 6
    ```c
    printf("%f\n", 3.14f); /* 3.140000 */
    printf("%3.3f\n", 3.14f); /* 3.140 */
    printf("%6.3f\n", 3.14f); /* (space)3.140 */
    ```
