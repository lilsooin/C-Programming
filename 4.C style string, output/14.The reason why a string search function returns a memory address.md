Unlike C#'s string.IndexOf() which returns the index of the string or creates a new string from the found position, why does it provide the address of the found position?


### Why does it return a memory address?
- Creating and returning a new string is not memory-efficient and can lead to errors in terms of memory management



### Where should the new string be stored? 1
- To return a new string, the string must be copied somewhere in memory
- If the copy is stored in the stack...
  - It disappears when the function ends -> the return value is no longer a valid address

```C
char* strstr(const char* str, const char* substr)
{
    char result[] = (found str from substr) /* string! I love C! */

    return result; /* when function ends, the value is no longer a valid address */
}

char msg[] = "I love string! I love C!";
char* result = strstr(msg, "string"); /* invalid address */
```


### Where should the new string be stored? 2
- If the copy is stored in the heap (dynamic memory allocation)...
  - It’s slower because memory allocation must be requested from the operating system
  - And if the memory is no longer used, the programmer must manually call a memory release function, which can be forgotten <- other languages handle this via the OS.

```C
char* strstr(const char* str, const char* substr)
{
    char result[] = malloc(); // A very simplified example of requesting memory allocation from the OS
    // Copying "string! I love C!" into the result
    return result;
}

char msg[] = "I love string! I love C!";
char* result = strstr(msg, "string");  // A valid address is obtained
free(result); // If it’s no longer used, it must be released
```
- If memory is allocated in a function and not released when the function ends, the data stays in memory -> memory leak



### Returning an address is the least error-prone method
- Returning the address where the substring starts in the original string is a simple solution
- It avoids using extra memory and reduces the potential for human error
