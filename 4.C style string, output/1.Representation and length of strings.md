### Difference between strings and other primitive data types
- Primitive data types have a fixed size
- The length of a string is not fixed



### How to represent "multiple" characters?
- Array: `char str[]`
- The length of an array cannot be determined automatically
- Therefore, the programmer needs to remember the length separately
```c
char str[] = "C is fun";
```
