```c
const char str[] = "MOON";
printf("str length: %d\n", sizeof(str));
```
- string size is 4
- array size is at least 5
- "M", "O", "O", "N", "\0"




### pros of C style string
- pros
    - The most memory-efficient-
    - 

- cons
    - The downside is that to determine the length of a string, you must traverse the entire array (time complexity O(N))


### concept of determining the length of a string
1. Start reading the elements of the char array from the beginning
2. Stop when you encounter the null character
3. Count the number of characters visited so far and return that value
```c
size_t get_string_length(const char* str)
{
    size_t i;
    for(i = 0; str[i] != '\0'; ++i) {

    }

    return i;
}
```
- Using pointers can make this operation more efficient!


```c
// using pointer1
size_t get_string_length(const char* str)
{
    const char* p = str;

    while(*p++ != '\0') {
    }

    return p - str - 1;
}
```


```c
// using pointer2
size_t get_string_length(const char* str)
{
    size_t count = 0;
    const char* p = str;

    while(*p++ != '\0') {
        ++count;
    }

   return count;
}
```



### here is already a function to get the length of a string
`size_t strlen(const char* str);`
- you can use it by including `<string.h>`
- It works almost the same as the code above



### Common mistake 1
```c
char str[] = { 'P', 'O', 'C', 'U' };
size_t len;

len = strlen(str);
printf("%d\n", len);
```
- Accessing memory beyond the intended area



### Common mistake 2
```c
#define BUFFER_LENGTH(4)

char str[BUFFER_LENGTH];
size_t len;

str[0] = 'M';
str[1] = 'O';
str[2] = 'O';
str[3] = 'N';

len = strlen(str);
printf("%d\n", len);
```
- Adding +1 to BUFFER_LENGTH




### This approach may not be safe
- You need to be extra careful when reading strings from external sources
- C11's `strlen_s()` function addresses these issues
- So, is `strlen(str)` safe?
    - It might be safe because it only reads the string
    - However, it might not always be safe
    - What if the null character doesn't appear?
    - If you read hardware-protected memory, a crash will occur
    - Accessing memory you don't own is extremely dangerous
