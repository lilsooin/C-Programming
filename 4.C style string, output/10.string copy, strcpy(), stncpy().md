### string copy
```c
void copy_string(char* dest, char* src)
{
    while (*src != '\0') {
        *dest++ = *src++;
    }

    *dest = '\0';
}

/* another function */
const char* str1 = "Pope";
char str2[5];

copy_string(str2, str1);
```



### string copy: strcpy()
`char* strcpy(char* dest, const char* src);`
- the function is in <string.h>
- return value char* is dest
- In C11, strcpy_s() returns errno_t



### however dest is shorter than src?
```c
const char* str1 = "Pope";
char str2[3];

string_copy(str2, str1);
```
- As seen with the stack, writing to someone else's memory is a problem
- It is a dangerous function
- However, if you can reliably control the sizes of src and dest, it is safe




### Relatively safe string copy: strncpy()1
- Copies up to the count value
- Stops if a null character is encountered before count
1. If src is shorter than count, it fills the remaining space with 0 ('\0')
2. If src is as long as or longer than count,
    - It copies up to count
    - There is no place to append a null character
    - Therefore, it doesn't append one

### Relatively safe string copy: strncpy()2
- So the programmer always needs to add a line of code
```c
strncpy(dest, src, DEST_SIZE); /* DEST_SIZE: 5 */
dest[DEST_SIZE - 1] = '\0';
```



### Summary: `strcpy()` vs `strncpy()`
- strcpy()
    - It is a potentially dangerous function
    - dest size < src size
        - It leads to writing to invalid memory
    - If both sizes are reliably controlled, it is safe

- strncpy()
    - It is less fast
        - Because it fills the remaining elements of dest with 0
    - There are still dangerous cases!
        - If src is longer than count,
            - It copies everything but doesn't add a null character
            - he programmer has to add the null character

- In C11, there are safer functions like `strcpy_s()` and `strncpy_s()`
