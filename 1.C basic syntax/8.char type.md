### char type

char
```C
char ch_a = 'a'; 
char ch_b = ch_a + 1; /* b */
char ch_c = 99;       /* c */
```
- At least 8bit integer type
- Standard is greater than 8bit
- So complier can define char size is 1million size

### ASCII Code
- 'A' = 65
- 'a' = 65 + 32 = 95

### finding char size
- **<limits.h>** header file includes,
		see  **CHAR_BIT**. you can find bit size
- c standard doesn't force exact data size
  - each compile has different data size
- 1 Byte is **CHAR_BIT** 
  - 1 Byte can be 8bit
  - 1 Byte can be 16bit
- Small device needs small data size


### char and ASCII Code
char
```C
char ch_a = 'a'; 
char ch_b = ch_a + 1; /* b */
char ch_c = 99;       /* c */
```
- Integer type
- char is enough to define ASCII code
- ASCII is `0-126`(7bit)(extended ASCII is greater)
  
### char and signed/unsigned
- char is integer type so it has **signed** and **unsigned**
- If signed/unsigned type isn't showed?
- People might think it would be signed type(becauseother integer type is like that)
- You know.. C standard didn't make the rule
- It depends on a compiler
	- singed type or unsigned type
	- Clang Windows is if the type is skipped it is sgined type

### The reason the char type does not have a default sign?
- ASCII is 0-127 so it isn't related to signed/unsigned(ASCII is only positive values)
- The rule is using `singed` or `unsigned` for data type
```c
signed char signed_char = -1;
unsigned char unsigned_char = 255;
```
- The only integer range for safe porting without issues is 0 to 127
	- 0000 0000(2) - 0111 1111(2)

### how to check char sign type
- **<limits.h>** header file **CHAR_MIN**

### char range standard
- unsigned char: 0-255
- char 0-127
- signed char -127~127
	- maxium is 127
	- because of 1's complement
	- old device used 1's complement not anymore now

### char range normal
- size: 8bit
- If sign type is skipped => signed
```c
char signed_char = -1;
```
- Range
	- unsigned: 0-255
	- signed: -128 to 127
