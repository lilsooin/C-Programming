### int
```c
int num = -32767; /* basic: signed */
unsigned int unsigned_int = 65535;
signed int signed_int = -32767;
```
- integer type
- standard: minimum `16bit` and equal or more than short size
- It is 16 bit because other languages are 32bit int



### int is basic integer
- int means integer
- int is basic data for CPU ALU(Arithmetic Logic Unit)
- the data is word
- Word data size is same as register data size
- Basically, it is supposed to depend on CPU size
- Back in the day, computers were usaully 16bit computer so minimum is 16bit



### int and 64bit platform
- 32bit computer came out and int size became 32bit
- Now even 64bit computer came out, it remains 32bit



### int range
- porting safe range: same as `short` size
- general range
	- size: 32bit
	- range
		- unsigned: 0 - 4,294,967,295
		- signed: -2,147,483,648 - 2,147,483,647



### int literal
```c
int signed_int = -1024;
unsigned int unsigned_int1 = 394;
unsigned int unsigned_int2 = 214783648; /* warning */
unsigned int unsigned_int3 = 214783648u; /* not warning */
```
- Literal
	- `'u'` or `'U'`



### long
```c
long num = -2147483648; /* basic: signed */
unsigned long unsigned_long = 2147483647;
signed long signed_long = -2147483648;
```
- If int is 16bit, it required twice as much as 16bit int.
- long is minimum is `32bit` and long size is equal or greater than int size
	- usaully other language's long size `64bit`(confusing)



### long(2)
- There is no 64bit integer data type in C89
- porting safe range: -2147483647 - 2147483647
- normal range: same as `int`



### long literal
```c
long singed_long = -200000000l  /* l, L */
unsigned long unsigned_long1 = 214783647; 
unsigned long unsigned_long2 = 214783648; /* warning */
unsigned long unsigned_long3 = 214783648ul; /* no warning */
```
- literal
	- 'l' or 'L': long
	- 'u' or 'U': unsigned
	- usaully use UL, ul
