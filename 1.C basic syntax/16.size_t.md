### size_t
- **unsigned integer type** but not it is not real data type
- `_t` means it is `typedef`



### size_t size
- In C89, it doesn't refer to size of **size_t**
- But if you make an array, you can find `array byte size`
- If it is 8bit, it is too low 2^8 = 255 and if there is integer array
it only can have 64 amount -> 4byte * 64 = 256
- In C99 required mininum 16bit
- It usually **unsigned int**



### Usage of size_t
- To express some data size
- Using for loop, array
    - loop counter is only positive value
    - array index is only positive value
        - there is no **my_array[-1]**
```c
int int_array[30];
size_t i;

for (i = 0; i < 30; ++i ) {
    int_array[i] = i;
}
/* int_array[i] = (int)i is more clear */
```



### size_t and -1
- In C# IndexOf() function return -1 if it can not find the characters
- size_t can do it same thing
    - size_t maximum value -> -1 bit pattern
        - **signed int** `-1` and **unsigned int** `4,294,967,295` has same pattern
```c
size_t get_students_index(const char* name)
{
    if (!/*조건*/) {
        return (size_t)-1;
    }

    return right_index;
}
/*
1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 unsigned maximum(4,294,967,295)
1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 signed -1
*/
```



### there is no exception keyword in C
