### unsigned and signed

- In C#, an unsigned data type is prefixed with the letter '**u**'
	- data type 'byte' is unsigned data type
	- To use signed byte, prefixed with the letter 's'
	 
- In C, should use '**unsigned**' word in front of the data type
	- eg. `unsigned char`, `unsigned int`
	- Can use `signed` word in front of the data type
		- eg. `signed char`, `signed int`
	- If it doesn't use `unsigned/signed`, we can assume it is **signed**
	- `signed int`  usually skip the **signed**

### unsigned and signed example

C#
```C#
byte unsignedByte = 300;
sbyte signedByte = -1000;

int signedInt = - 10000;
uint usignedInt = 5000;
```



C
```C
char default_char = 100;
signed char signed_char = -100;
unsigned char unsigned_char = 500;

int default_int = -1000;
signed int signed_int = -100;
unsigned int unsigned_int = 500;
```
