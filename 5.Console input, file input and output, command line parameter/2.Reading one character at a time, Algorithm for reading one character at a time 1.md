### Algorithm for reading one character at a time - trial 1
1. Read a character
2. Use that character where needed.
3. Go back to step 1

### Code for reading one character at a time
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int c;

while (TRUE) {
    c = getchar(); /* #define TRUE(1) */
    putchar(c);
}
```

### Code for reading one character at a time 1
1. `getchar()` function is still waiting (not yet returned)
2. Type 'a' on the keyboard and press Enter

### Code for reading one character at a time 2
1. `getchar()` function is still waiting (not yet returned)
2. Type 'a' on the keyboard and press Enter
3. Read a character from the buffer

### Code for reading one character at a time 3
1. `getchar()` function is still waiting (not yet returned)
2. Type 'a' on the keyboard and press Enter
3. Read a character from the buffer
4. Print the read character

### Code for reading one character at a time 4
1. `getchar()` function is still waiting (not yet returned)
2. Type 'a' on the keyboard and press Enter
3. Read a character from the buffer
4. Print the read character
5. If there are still characters in the buffer, go back to step 3

### Code for reading one character at a time 5
1. `getchar()` function is still waiting (not yet returned)
2. Type 'a' on the keyboard and press Enter
3. Read a character from the buffer
4. Print the read character
5. If there are no more characters in the buffer, go back to step 1

### getChar() Half-baked explanation
```c
int getchar(void);
int fgetc(FILE* steram);
```
- Reads a character from the keyboard (stdio) and returns it as an `int`
- Equivalent to `fgetc(stdin)`
