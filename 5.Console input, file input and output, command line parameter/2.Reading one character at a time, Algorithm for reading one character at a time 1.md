### Algorithm for reading one character at a time - trial 1
1. Read a character
2. Use that character where needed.
3. Go back to step 1

### Code for reading one character at a time
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int c;

while (TRUE) {
    c = getchar(); /* #define TRUE(1) */
    putchar(c);
}
```

### Code for reading one character at a time
1. `getchar()` function is still waiting (not yet returned)
2. Type 'a' on the keyboard and press Enter

### getChar() Half-baked explanation
```c
int getchar(void);
int fgetc(FILE* steram);
```
- Reads a character from the keyboard (stdio) and returns it as an `int`
- Equivalent to `fgetc(stdin)`
