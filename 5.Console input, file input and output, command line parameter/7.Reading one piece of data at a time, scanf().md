### There is a function that formats output nicely
- There is a function that prints multiple data types nicely in the output
- print formatted -> printf()
- Reading is also possible
  


### Three versions exist
1. scanf(): reads from stdin
`int scanf(const char* format, ...);`
2. fscanf(): reads from a file stream
`int fscanf(FILE* stream, const char* format, ...);`
3. sscanf(): reads from a C-style string
`int sscanf(const char* buffer, const char* format, ...);`
- scanf(): reads input from the keyboard
  


### scanf()
`int scanf(const char* format, ...);`
- It is found in <stdio.h>
- It receives input from the keyboard (stdin) and stores it in a variable
  


### Why pass the address of the variable to be stored?
`scanf("%d", &num);`
- It mimics call-by-reference
- If you just pass num, it's a copied parameter. Changing it inside the function will disappear after returning
  


### The return value of scanf()
- So, what does scanf() return?
- It returns how many items of data were read
- If it fails before reading the first data, it returns EOF
