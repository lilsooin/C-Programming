### Algorithm for reading one character at a time - trial 2
1. Read a character
2. If reading a character fails (EOF), terminate the program
3. Otherwise, use the character where needed
4. Go back to step 1

### Code for reading one character at a time
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int c;

c = getchar();

while (c != EOF) {
    c = getchar(); 
    putchar(c);
}
```

### EOF key
- ctrl + different key
  - windows: ctrl + z
  - unix : ctrl + d
- ``ctrl + z + enter``
- In linux, same need enter


### change while loop
- It can be shortened
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int c;

c = getchar();

while ((c = getchar()) != EOF) {
    putchar(c);
}
```
- But not recommended(poor readability)
  

### When reading one character at a time is useful
- The simplest input method
- Very good for character/string input
- No need to store input in memory unnecessarily
  - Saves memory
  - Reduces errors
- O(N) complexity
  - Often suitable for algorithms that require only a single iteration of a for loop
  - What's the difference between the following two methods?
    - Reading all input and storing it in an array, then processing with a for loop
    - Reading one character at a time from the keyboard and processing immediately
  - However, it's a bit difficult to use for other data types
    - For example, reading an integer like 1004.
    - '1', '0', '0', '4' read four times and convert to integer..
  - Suitable for use with characters and strings
