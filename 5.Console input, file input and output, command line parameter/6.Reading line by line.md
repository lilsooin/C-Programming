- A surprisingly useful approach


### An algorithm that reads one line at a time
1. Reads one line
2. If reading a line fails, the program terminates
3. If successful, the read line is used as needed
4. Returns to step 1
 


### How do we read one line?
- Where do we store the read line?
    - The programmer passes a pre-made array to the function
    - The function reads a line into that array


  

### gets()
`char* gets(char* str);`
- Continues reading characters from stdin until a newline character ('\n') or EOF is encountered, storing them in the str array
    - Thus, str is not constant
- Inserts a null character ('\0') right after the last character
- The newline character is removed from stdin but not stored in the buffer
  


### gets() return value
`char* gets(char* str);`
- What is returned?
    - On success, str
    - On failure, **NULL** (a pointer, not a null character)


  


### Reading one line
```c
#include <stdio.h>

#define LINE_LENGTH (64)

char line[LINE_LENGTH]

while (gets(line) != NULL) {
    puts(line);
}
```
- A very, very, very dangerous function
- C11 has completely removed the function
- Thus, in modern header files, gets() no longer exists
    - If you insist on using it, you must declare the function prototype manually


  


### Why is it dangerous?
- If more than 64 characters are entered -> Buffer overflow
- Increasing it further increases the risk of overflow


  

### What happens if an overflow occurs?
- The value entered by the keyboard is written to an invalid memory address
- You can exploit the vulnerability by manipulating the values of previous local variables on the stack
- Do not use gets()
