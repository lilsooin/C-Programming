### input 
- The opposite of output
Reading external data for
- Reading external data for use in a program
- Strange data often comes in because we don't know what data will be input
    - The user enters incorrect data from the keyboard
    - Someone has incorrectly modified a previously saved file or some data has been lost



### Input is more complicated than output
- There are many things to be careful about compared to output
- If data reading fails and is not handled properly, errors occur
- Mistakes happen very often
- Therefore, every input function has a return value
- **So, be sure to read the documentation to know what value each function returns, and check it in the code**
- Most issues with input handling code arise from not properly reading what the return value is in the documentation :(




### Where does the input come from?
- Where do we read the input from?
- If you have outputted somewhere, itâ€™s easy to think you can read from there
- Stream
    - If output is in the console, the input is received from the console (keyboard)
    - If output is to a file (saved), then the input is read from the file
    - And so on
- String
    - If output is to a string (saved), then the input is read from the string
- There were almost similar functions for wherever you output
- The same goes for input




### There are four main strategies
1. Reading one character at a time
2. Reading one line at a time
3. Reading one data item at a time
4. Reading one block at a time (binary data)
